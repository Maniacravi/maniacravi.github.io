## About Me

I'm a Biomedical Engineer and Data Scientist working on, and enthusiastic about, the intersection of Humans, Sensors and AI. I've spent over a decade developing algorithms that translate complex physiological signals - from EMG and ECG to PPG and IMU data - into meaningful, actionable information. 

I currently work at Kessler Foundation's [Center for Spinal Stimulation](https://kesslerfoundation.org/research/tim-and-caroline-reynolds-center-spinal-stimulation), leading biomedical signal processing and machine learning projects focused on [Neuromodulation](https://www.neuromodulation.com/about-neuromodulation) and spinal cord injury research. 

My long-term goal is to build technologies that make physiological data more actionable and interpretable. I’m endlessly curious about how technology can deepen our understanding of the body — the signals we measure tell stories about how we move, sleep, think, and even feel.

## Personal Life

I live in New Jersey where I split my time between work, side [projects](projects), playing badminton, watching physics lectures, reading philosophy books and catching up on sports - basketball, soccer and test cricket (yes, it's 5 days long but there's nothing quite like it!).
